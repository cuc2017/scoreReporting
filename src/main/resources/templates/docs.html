				<h3>Duties</h3>
				<p>As scorekeepers you have three main duties:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Keeping track of the score</li>
					<li>Game time management</li>
					<li>Keeping stats (goals and assist)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>At most games there should be 2 scorekeepers so you should
					have someone to help.</p>
				<h3>Equipment</h3>
				<p>Everything you need to score keep should be in the
					scorekeeper kit. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Score sheets</li>
					<li>Spirit score sheets</li>
					<li>Pens</li>
					<li>Tablet for live score keeping</li>
					<li>Whistle (and wipes to clean it)</li>
					<li>Stop watch</li>
					<li>Rule book</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You will also have a short range radio to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ask for help</li>
					<li>If water is very low or out (you can also flag down a
						member of the field service team)</li>
					<li>Seek medical or emergency assistance</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Keeping Track of the Score and Stats</h3>
				<p>
					The official score and stats are kept on the <a
						href="doc/CUC2017_ScoreSheet.pdf">score sheet</a>. Please try and
					fill in out as accurately as possible. If you did not see who scored the goal or threw the assist, please ask the team that scored.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are also doing live score reporting using a tablet. A test
					system of which can be found at <a href="/score">Score a Game</a>.
					This is a test system so feel free to try it out. You do not need to login to use the test system.
				</p>
				<p>At the fields, the tablets should be logged on and ready to
					go. To start scoring a game select SCORE GAME from the navigation
					bar.</p>
				<p>
					At the end of the game, ensure both captains sign the <a
						href="doc/CUC2017_ScoreSheet.pdf">score sheet</a> and each
					complete a <a href="doc/CUC2017_SpiritScoreSheet.pdf">spirit
						score sheet</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Game Time Management</h3>
				<p>
					You are acting as a timekeeper as well as a scorekeeper. You will
					have a whistle (there are wipes to clean it before/after you use
					it) and a stopwatch (or you can use the timing on the tablet). The
					details on time management can be found on the <a
						href="doc/CUC2017_ScorekeepersCheatSheet.pdf">Scorekeepers
						Cheat Sheet.</a>
				</p>
				<p>If there are observers at the game, the score keepers are not
					responsible for time management.</p>
				<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
				<p>You are our eyes and ears on what is happening on the fields
					and during games. If you have any problems or concerns, please find
					one of the members of the local organizing committee or contact us
					by using the radio.</p>
				<p>Have a great time watching Canadaâ€™s top teams compete at the
					Canadian Ultimate Championships.</p>
