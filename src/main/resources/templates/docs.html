        <h3>Duties</h3>
        <p>As scorekeepers you have three main duties:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Keeping track of the score</li>
          <li>Keeping stats (goals and assist)</li>
          <li>Time keeping</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At most games there should be 2 scorekeepers so you should have someone to help.</p>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>Everything you need to score keep should be in the scorekeeper kit. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Score sheets</li>
          <li>Spirit score sheets</li>
          <li>Pens</li>
          <li>Tablet for live score keeping</li>
          <li>Whistle (and wipes to clean it)</li>
          <li>Stop watch</li>
          <li>Rule book</li>
          <li>Contact sheet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the contact sheet to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask for help</li>
          <li>If water is very low or out (you can also flag down a member of the field service team)</li>
          <li>Seek medical or emergency assistance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Keeping Track of the Score and Stats</h3>
        <p>
          The official score and stats are kept on the <a href="doc/CUC2019_ScoreSheet.pdf">score sheet</a>. Please try
          and fill in out as accurately as possible. If you did not see who scored the goal or threw the assist, please
          ask the team that scored. Take a look at the <a href="doc/CUC2019_Example_ScoreSheet.pdf">example score sheet</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also doing live score reporting using a tablet. A test system of which can be found at <a href="/score">Score
            a Game</a>. This is a test system so feel free to try it out. You do not need to login to use the test system.
        </p>
        <p>At the fields, the tablets should be logged on and ready to go. To start scoring a game select SCORE GAME
          from the navigation bar.</p>
        <p>
          At the end of the game, ensure both captains sign the <a href="doc/CUC2019_ScoreSheet.pdf">score sheet</a> and
          each spirt captain completes a <a href="doc/CUC2018_SpiritScoreSheet.pdf">spirit score sheet</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Time keeping</h3>
        <p>You are acting as a timekeeper as well as a scorekeeper. You will have a whistle (there are wipes to
          clean it before/after you use it) and a stopwatch (or you can use the timing on the tablet). You blow the
          whistle as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Between Points and for Timeouts
            <ul>50 seconds - blow the whistle once
            </ul>
            <ul>70 seconds - blow the whistle twice
            </ul>
            <ul>90 seconds - blow the whistle three times
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Half Time
            <ul>4:20 seconds - blow the whistle once
            </ul>
            <ul>4:40 seconds - blow the whistle twice
            </ul>
            <ul>5:00 seconds - blow the whistle three times
            </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

        Further details on time keeping can be found on the <a href="doc/CUC2019_ScorekeepersNotes.pdf">Scorekeepers
          Cheat Sheet.</a>
        </p>
        <p>If there are observers at the game, the score keepers are not responsible for time management.</p>
